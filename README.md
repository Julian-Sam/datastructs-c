Arraylist and Hashtable in C
============================

(c) 2011 @marekweb

Goal
----

Lists and mappings are two of the most common generic data types. This library implements both in pure C. It aims to be simple and concise, while being completely generic.

It uses void pointers (`void*`) as the value type, which means it can be used to store any kind of data references without requiring you to do anything to adapt your code. Just pass and receive `void*` values to and from the library.


Use in your project
-------------------

This library uses headers generated by `makeheaders`. The `#if INTERFACE` lines are artifacts of this. You don't have to worry about this if you're not making changes to the files.


Array Lists
-----------

The `arraylist.c` file contains an array list implementation. It is implemented as a dynamic array which is automatically resized as needed.

Usage:
    arraylist* mylist = arraylist_create();
    arraylist_add(mylist, value);
    arraylist_pop(mylist);


Hash Tables
-----------

The `hashtable.c` file contains a hash table implementation. It is implemented with open addressing and linear probing. It is automatically resized as needed.

Usage:
    hashtable* mytable = hashtable_create();
    hashtable_set(mytable, "foo", value1);
    hashtable_remove(mytable, "boo");
    return hashtable_get(mytable, "bar");
